> **Townlight Beta 1 release:** [signed Windows installer, exact owned source, documentation and acceptance](https://github.com/townlight/townlight/releases/tag/townlight-beta-1). [Online manual](https://townlight.github.io/manuals/planning.html). This retained manual edition describes the accepted candidate before publication; distribution has changed, component versions and signed bytes have not.

# Townlight Planning

**Townlight Beta 1** · Existing component versions retained · AGPL-3.0-only

Planning retains adopted policy imports and neighborhood applicability, saved staff analyses, reviewed snapshots, municipal initiatives and amendment history. An analysis or amendment draft does not adopt policy.

## Start here

Staff should use the operating manual. Administrators should read first-run, configuration and recovery before changing a deployment. Developers should read the exact API/schema reference and matching source companion. This edition accompanies Townlight Beta 1; use the release link above for the signed candidate and exact source/documentation archives.

“Townlight Beta 1” identifies this coordinated beta delivery. It does not renumber the installer, native binary, Python packages or historical receipts. Component versions may differ. This documentation is a later companion to unchanged signed bytes, not a rebuilt installer. Historical release pages and manuals describe their own versions and are not the download instructions for this private candidate.

## What staff can do

- **Import adopted policy:** Open Policy library. Preview jurisdiction, adoption/source dates, policy IDs, neighborhood applicability and originals, then confirm the complete source bundle. Retain the previous revision.
- **Create or reopen an analysis:** Open Analyses and select the project. Use Next page when the loaded page does not contain the saved work. Enter the proposal, analysis and private staff notes.
- **Select policies and evidence:** In Policies & evidence select exact policy revisions and applicable neighborhood context. Record supporting, conflicting or uncertain considerations. Select permitted Meetings or Zoning evidence with its expected hash.
- **Save and reconcile:** Use Save draft before navigating or signing out. When another revision exists, reopen it and reconcile your edits. Do not resubmit against a guessed revision identifier.
- **Review the saved revision:** In Review & export check the audience, public summary and review notes. Save, then Record review of saved draft. The trusted staff path derives identity/date. Editing later produces a new revision requiring review.
- **Create and export a snapshot:** Preview the reviewed saved revision, inspect the returned content, then create the snapshot. Public copies exclude staff notes and full staff analysis under the public contract. Export verifies the expected SHA256.
- **Track initiatives and amendments:** Create and revise municipal initiative status, responsibility, targets, milestones and measurements using the existing controls. Retain history. Draft and review amendments separately; adoption must identify the actual adopted source revision.
- **Share deliberately:** Select a permitted snapshot in Records. Creating a snapshot does not publish it, release a request or adopt policy.

## Operating procedures and examples

The operating manual now includes these existing procedures, with synthetic inputs, readback and limits. Follow the actual app boundary identified there; a standalone source capability is not automatically a desktop screen.

## Architecture and data

### Runtime and storage

The accepted package targets **Windows x64 fresh installation**. Its native shell uses **Rust 2021, Tauri 2 and Microsoft WebView2**; browser assets are JavaScript built with **Vite 8.1.6**. This describes the native desktop frontend; Station has a separate React operator, specified below or in its product manual. Canonical business workflows use bundled **CPython 3.13.5, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy and Alembic**, with **PostgreSQL 17 / PostGIS** and managed original files. The installed runtime tested here contains FastAPI 0.162.0. Package minimum Python requirements can differ from the bundled executable; the metadata reference preserves both. No stack rewrite is implied by the beta label.

The native transport is fixed to loopback `127.0.0.1:15480`; PostgreSQL uses the configured local runtime port (default `15432`). Optional local model service defaults to `127.0.0.1:15434`. Those are deployment defaults, not internet endpoints. The runtime has health, module and readiness endpoints; readiness is stronger than process existence. The task queue is the existing local Core task infrastructure, not an assertion that a separate Redis service is required for this desktop composition.

The default native profile is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CivicSuite`; the historical directory name remains part of compatibility. Do not rename it to Townlight. A configured `TOWNLIGHT_PROFILE_ROOT` must be absolute. Local configuration and secrets live under that profile; protected managed files and database state must be backed up coherently. Source/runtime identity is distinct from a product’s display label.

### Data and consistency

Plan bundles and revisions; original documents; versioned policy selections and neighborhood applicability; analysis revisions; reviews and snapshots; initiatives, milestones and measurements; amendment revisions.

Versioned saves use expected prior revision identifiers where defined. Reopen and reconcile on conflict. Exact exports and handoffs use source IDs, current visibility, revision and SHA256. Review belongs to the saved revision and does not transfer silently to edited text. Database changes use the owning product’s migrations; a request or readiness check is not an authorization to mutate schema.

### Capacity and platform statements

This beta has synthetic single-profile workflow evidence. It does not have a published benchmark for concurrent staff capacity, minimum RAM/CPU, large-source limits or a field SLA. Do not turn a developer machine’s specification into a supported minimum. Installer size is 2,092,122,112 bytes before installation; allow additional disk for extracted runtime, database, originals, exports, media and backups. Select equipment/storage after sizing those actual workloads.

The exact [runtime payload lock](docs/beta-1/reference/runtime-payload-lock.json) records pinned files, sizes and hashes. The [component metadata](docs/beta-1/reference/component-metadata.json) records shipped dependency declarations. These references are more precise than a manually copied dependency list. Third-party and historical license notices must accompany their matching payloads.


| Data contract | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Input | Complete adopted policy source bundles, proposal context, versioned policy selections, permitted Meetings/Zoning evidence and staff progress updates. |
| Retained records | Plan bundles and revisions; original documents; versioned policy selections and neighborhood applicability; analysis revisions; reviews and snapshots; initiatives, milestones and measurements; amendment revisions. |
| Output | Cited analyses, audience-specific reviewed snapshots, durable initiative/history records and amendment lifecycle records. |
| Connections | Selects Meetings and Zoning evidence. Provides permitted reviewed snapshots to Records. Source selection is permission- and hash-checked and is not automatic writeback. |


## Setup and operation

1. Obtain the identified signed private candidate and its corresponding-source companion from the beta coordinator. The landing pages in this documentation are not an installer download service.
2. On the intended fresh Windows test installation, verify the MSI hash and publisher signature before installing. Preserve unrelated profiles and recovery material. This candidate has fresh-install acceptance; historical in-place upgrades are unverified.
3. Launch Townlight under the intended named Windows account. Choose the storage folders. Select **Townlight Inspections candidate** (`inspections-preview`) for all eight desktop products. A narrower default selection will not expose all workspaces.
4. Enter the city profile, time zone and contacts. Create the first named local administrator, sign in and choose protected backup storage. **Continue without local AI** is valid for the deterministic workflows.
5. Run Health Check and wait for readiness. Open Townlight. In System Health select **Finish Records Migration** to activate the canonical Python/PostgreSQL runtime. Do not fabricate migration receipts or seed accounts.
6. Create named staff through Settings. Import authorized sources using each product’s source library. All examples in this package are synthetic; they are not municipal authority.
7. Provision Station separately if it is part of the beta exercise. Selecting the desktop composition does not start or configure Station. Configure vision explicitly only if automatic photo drafting is selected.

## Configuration
### Native deployment configuration

Use Setup, Settings and System Health for supported staff operation. Administrators provision folders, backup storage, named accounts and the city profile. Select `inspections-preview` for the full eight-workspace desktop. Station remains a separate service boundary. Do not use a standalone product’s demo server as a substitute for the installed workspace.

Technical deployments use `TOWNLIGHT_PRODUCT_PROFILE`, `TOWNLIGHT_PROFILE_ROOT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `CIVICSUITE_RUNTIME_PORT`, `PORTAL_MODE` and the runtime-managed secret files. Treat database URLs and native session proofs as secrets. The installed native domain runtime explicitly refuses non-loopback binding. `PORTAL_MODE=private` is the accepted posture; changing it does not by itself commission an internet portal, authentication provider or reverse proxy.

The isolated documentation exporter sets a fictional profile and unusable synthetic database origin only to read schemas; those values are not deployment configuration. Keep deployment values in the intended process/account scope. An already-running process does not automatically inherit later environment edits.

## API usage
### Native command example

The following JavaScript belongs in the existing trusted Townlight frontend/development environment with `invoke` imported from `@tauri-apps/api/core`. It is not a command for an arbitrary web page or an instruction for nontechnical staff. IDs must come from records created in an isolated synthetic exercise.

```javascript
import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/core';
const result = await invoke('planning_domain_request', {request: {operation: 'sources', offset: 0}});
console.log(result);
```

### Trusted local HTTP example

An administrator/developer can inspect an already-configured isolated runtime from a trusted local process. This PowerShell example reads the signed-in synthetic profile’s existing proof into memory; it does not create a user, seed a session, reveal the proof in output or bypass a permission check. Do not use real city data in development examples. A read response does not prove approval or publication.

```powershell
$profilePath = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA 'CivicSuite'
$sessionPath = Join-Path $profilePath 'config\local-session.json'
$session = Get-Content -LiteralPath $sessionPath -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
$headers = @{ 'X-Townlight-Session' = $session.session_hash }
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:15480/desktop/v1/planning/sources' -Headers $headers
Remove-Variable session, headers
```

### Complete synthetic source bundle

The [synthetic Planning bundle](docs/beta-1/reference/examples/synthetic-plan-bundle.json) is the retained fixture used by the beta staff exercise. It includes the complete supported source envelope rather than a shortened pseudo-payload. Keep its fictional source labels. For Planning, wrap it as `{"bundle": BUNDLE, "expected_previous_revision": null}`; for Permitting use `{"bundle": BUNDLE, "expected_revision": null}`. Code and Zoning take their own complete import envelopes. Replace null with the current expected revision when revising an existing source, as the applicable schema requires. These are import examples, not legal authority or permission to load them into a live city profile.

### A synthetic write with subsequent readback

This example demonstrates the existing Meetings HTTP contract in an isolated exercise. It is intentionally fictional. It does not start a service. Its authentication setup is included so it can be run independently under the signed-in synthetic account. If a write times out, inspect current records before repeating it.

```powershell
$profilePath = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA 'CivicSuite'
$sessionPath = Join-Path $profilePath 'config/local-session.json'
$session = Get-Content -LiteralPath $sessionPath -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
$headers = @{ 'X-Townlight-Session' = $session.session_hash }
$body = @{
  title = 'Synthetic documentation exercise'
  scheduled_start = '2026-11-05T18:00:00-07:00'
  location = 'Synthetic room'
  meeting_type = 'regular'
} | ConvertTo-Json
$meeting = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri 'http://127.0.0.1:15480/desktop/v1/meetings/meetings' `
  -Headers $headers -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body
Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri ('http://127.0.0.1:15480/desktop/v1/meetings/meetings/' + $meeting.id) `
  -Headers $headers
Remove-Variable session, headers
```

This write requires Meetings to be enabled and the signed-in staff role to permit it. It is a cross-suite integration example; for this product’s request models, use the complete technical reference below.

## MCP status

No direct product MCP server is exposed by the accepted Townlight desktop or Station boundary. Do not configure an invented `townlight mcp` command or assume an AI client has staff permissions. The integration surfaces for this beta are native IPC, the documented HTTP APIs, source bundle imports, exact exports and the existing Station CLI.

The bundled transcription code includes a **TextFlowKit MCP adapter** as a separate source capability. It offers job-based `transcribe_media`, `get_transcript`, `list_jobs`, `get_job_status` and `export_transcript`, and additional tools declared in that adapter. It uses stdio first and optional Streamable HTTP, with the MCP SDK as an optional extra. It is not automatically launched, authenticated as Townlight staff or accepted as a Townlight product MCP deployment. This documentation does not add such a service.

For a transcription client already provisioned separately, an illustrative tool call is:

```json
{"name":"get_job_status","arguments":{"job_id":"synthetic-existing-job-id"}}
```

Use a job ID returned by that transcription service. This example does not create a Townlight record or bypass its review/Records handoff. The exact optional adapter tool signatures are supplied in the [MCP source reference](docs/beta-1/reference/mcp.html). Station meeting capture does not become live speech recognition because this optional donor adapter exists.

## Verification and known limits

| Product | Recorded result | Precisely exercised |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planning | PASS | Adopted source import with neighborhood, saved/reviewed analysis and snapshot, persisted initiative/history and draft amendment, public explorer neighborhood readback and native workspace. |


These results come from the identified signed candidate’s fresh normal-profile Sandbox exercise: real native IPC/HTTP/PostgreSQL and selected headless controls. All accounts, source bundles and media were synthetic. The guest install/uninstall and recovery passed, and the owned Sandbox stopped. No host installed application or standalone CivicCast was changed. This documentation task reuses those receipts; it does not claim a new software acceptance run.

The [workflow matrix](docs/beta-1/reference/workflow-matrix.json) identifies raw receipt filenames. The [evidence index](docs/beta-1/reference/sandbox-evidence-index.json) retains their original hashes; raw receipts remain in the private beta handoff rather than being silently republished with the documentation site.

The limits remain: actual city field acceptance and equipment/network commissioning; Station automatic provisioning/SCM commissioning; every UI/role combination; field recognition accuracy; and historical in-place upgrades are not certified. They are not five invented feature requirements. Fresh-install controlled beta handoff remains the accepted scope. This package makes no city-deployment, publication or general-availability claim.

Existing initiative/amendment persistence is included. A draft amendment does not change an adopted source revision. Historical standalone sample pages are not the installed staff workspace. Analysis lists and project filters operate on loaded pages; use pagination to reach additional records.

## Development and repository map

Use the corresponding source for the candidate rather than assuming the public default branch matches it. The source companion contains `installed-owned-source`, product build inputs, desktop Rust/browser sources, locks and `BUILD.md`. It excludes credentials and third-party binary/model payloads. Use the recorded runtime lock when reproducing packaging.

Relevant source contracts:

- `civicplan/source_bundle.py`
- `civicplan/workflow_models.py`
- `civicplan/workflow_store.py`
- `civicplan/municipal.py`
- `civicsuite_runtime/planning_bridge.py`

The desktop package defines `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run test:browser` and its Tauri command. Python products retain their own `pyproject.toml`, tests and migrations; use the matching checkout’s declared dependencies and test configuration. Do not run a sample server against a production profile. This documentation build validates documentation only and reuses the separately identified installed acceptance; it does not claim a new complete application CI run.

## Recovery and support

Save work and use Core’s canonical **Backup Now** before maintenance. That operation stops writers. Preserve the coherent profile/database/document backup and its receipt, then use **Start** to resume. A source export is not a full backup.

Use **Restore Latest Backup** through the supported controls. If the result says **Restore needs service start**, use **Start**, then **Check**, and reopen a known record. Do not repeat restore merely because services need to start. The fresh-profile acceptance verified that a fulfilled request survived restore and a post-backup marker did not.

Keep Station’s dedicated database and media evidence together in its own backup. Core’s native-profile backup must not be assumed to include an external Station data directory. Stop writers during a coordinated backup. Preserve failed media attempts and logs.

On failure, record the time, selected composition, component/installer versions and exact message. Check System Health for stopped, starting, ready or failed dependencies. Use the existing Retry control after readiness; do not create duplicate business records to refresh a stale view. Share only a redacted diagnostic bundle. Preserve secrets, original evidence, recovery material and unrelated installations.

## License and responsible use

Current owned code is AGPL-3.0-only. Preserve full license, matching corresponding source, dependency notices and historical grants. Terms of use do not remove license rights. Source imports do not confer permission to publish third-party material. Review all automatic drafts and use the separate owning-product decision before official action. CivicCast remains independent.

## Earlier documentation

Previous editions are retained under `docs/history/pre-townlight-beta-1/`. They describe their original software and license grants. Use the current Townlight Beta 1 manual for this candidate.
